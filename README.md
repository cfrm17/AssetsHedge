The FX assets hedge model is employed to conduct the hedge effectiveness test for the foreign currency denominated floating rate LIBOR assets using CAD funding. The hedging derivative is a cross currency interest rate swap. The hedging is designated as the Cash Flow Hedging in which both interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk are hedged.
